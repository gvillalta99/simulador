Core package for the Career Path Simulator.

This package contains the core logic for the simulator, separated into modules for:
- Configuration (`config.py`): Stores initial data, state definitions, and default parameters.
- Simulation Engine (`simulation.py`): Handles the Markov chain simulation, transition matrices, and career progression logic.
- Plotting Utilities (`plotting.py`): Provides functions to generate visualizations of simulation results.
